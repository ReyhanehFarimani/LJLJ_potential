As part of my Ph.D. work in August 2023, I have prepared a report on the behavior of star polymers in solvents with varying quality. This section is taken from another part of my work and is now available in a public mode on a GitHub repository at \href{https://github.com/ReyhanehFarimani/LJLJ_potential.git}{This Git-Hub Repository}.

The report aims to replicate the findings of Huissmann \textit{et al.}~\cite{Huissmann2009} and analyze the behavior of star polymers under different solvent conditions. Its primary purpose is to verify the accuracy of the new pair potential designed for the Lammps MD package~\cite{LAMMPS}.
