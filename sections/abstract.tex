This is a report of part of my Ph.D. work on July/August 2023.\\
This section is extracted from the other part so it can be in public mode in a \href{https://github.com/ReyhanehFarimani/LJLJ_potential.git}{GitHub repository}.\\
In this report, the behavior of star polymers in solvents of varying quality is going to be studied.
This is just a reproduction of a work by Huissmann \textit{et al.} ~\cite{Huissmann2009}. The actual use of the work is to check if the new pair potential designed for the Lammps MD package is working properly or not~\cite{LAMMPS}.
