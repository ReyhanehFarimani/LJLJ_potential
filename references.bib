   abstract = {We employ extensive computer simulations to investigate the conformations and the interactions of ring polymers under conditions of worsening solvent quality, in comparison with those for linear polymers. We determine the dependence of the Θ-temperature on knotedness by considering ring polymers of different topologies. We establish a clear decrease of the former upon changing the topology of the polymer from linear to an unknotted ring and a further decrease of the same upon introducing trefoil- or 5-fold knots but we find no difference in the Θ-point between the two knotted molecules. Our results are based on two independent methods: one considering the scaling of the gyration radius with molecular weight and one based on the dependence of the effective interaction on solvent quality. In addition, we calculate several shape-parameters of the polymers to characterize linear, unknotted, and knotted topologies in good solvents and in the proximity of the Θ-point. The shape parameters of the knotted molecules show an interesting crossover at a degree of polymerization that depends on the degree of knottedness of the molecule. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Zahra,
   abstract = {We investigate the effects of topological constraints in catenanes composed of interlinked ring polymers on their size in a good solvent as well as on the location of their θ-point when the solvent quality is worsened. We mainly focus on poly[n]catenanes consisting of n ring polymers each of length m interlocked in a linear fashion. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the scaling of the poly[n]catenane's radius of gyration in a good solvent, assuming in general that Rg ∼ mμnν and we find that μ = 0.65 ± 0.02 and ν = 0.60 ± 0.01 for the range of n and m considered. These findings are further rationalized with the help of a mean-field Flory-like theory yielding the values of μ = 16/25 and ν = 3/5, consistent with the numerical results. We show that individual rings within catenanes feature a surplus swelling due to the presence of NL topological links. Furthermore, we consider poly[n]catenanes in solvents of varying quality and we demonstrate that the presence of topological links leads to an increase of its θ-temperature in comparison to isolated linear and ring chains with the following ordering: Tθcatenane > Tθlinear > Tθring. Finally, we show that the presence of links similarly raises the θ-temperature of a single linked ring in comparison to an unlinked one, bringing its θ-temperature close to the one of a poly[n]catenane.},
